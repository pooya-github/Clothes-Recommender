# Clothes-Recommender
This code shows similar clothes to your cloth choice
I build embeddings and filenames and put it in my google drive. If you open google colab and put these codes on it and load the zalando dataset, embeddings and filenames files to google colab and run the code, then you can select your desire dress and see similar clothes to your selected dress from zalando dataset.
